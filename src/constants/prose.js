  ContactDescription:
    `A huge part of the reason I've started this site and continue to write is the desire to bring more conversation into my life.
    More conversation means more of many things - volume, more depth, and across more and diverse people - into my life.
    I want to continue learning at every possible juncture, and ideally present these learnings for the benefit of others.
    So please, when I say reach out, I mean it.`,
  ImprintsDescription:
    `We consume a lot of different kinds of media every day.
    Although our consumption - in volume, variety, and pace - is increasing. The rate at which we can reflect on and integrate this various media is not keeping pace.
    In the age of the internet, things tend to get lost.
    Not lost like on a desert island, but rather lost as in your keys under the couch.
    They're definitely somewhere in the house, but you can't quite put your finger on it.
    So for fun, for my own education, and for my future self, I'm going to compile those things that have impacted me... at least those that I can identify consciously.
    I'm calling this effort 'Imprints', for the impression, influence, and lasting joy or sorrow that each piece has left in me.`,

  ResonanceDescription:
    `Resonance is the phenomenon
    In that sense, all domains have some relationship,
    some cyclical interaction by which .
    I seek to explore it.
    Resonant sounds are those that reinforce, deep, clear, and continuing to ring out.
    Writing, as any linguistic expression, makes things exist for us in a new mode, deeper, full of awareness, resonant.
    Of my writing I hope to ask, ‘does it resound?’, and find the answer to be ‘deeply.’`,
