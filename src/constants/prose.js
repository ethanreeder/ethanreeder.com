    some cyclical interaction by which .
    I seek to explore it.
    Resonant sounds are those that reinforce, deep, clear, and continuing to ring out.

  ContactDescription:
    `A huge part of the reason I've started this site and continue to write is the desire to bring more conversation into my life.
    More conversation means more of many things - volume, more depth, and across more and diverse people - into my life.
    I want to continue learning at every possible juncture, and ideally present these learnings for the benefit of others.
    So please, when I say reach out, I mean it.`,
