# Ethics of Leverage



leverage is something that helps you multiply your output

there are three principle types of leverage

1. people
2. capital
3. technology



leverage is essential to creating lasting change

even the most dedicated single activist is no match for a coalition of idiot corporatists just by virtue of hours in the day

people leverage is the least efficient, but the most like our hominid tribal roots and the healthiest

capital gets passed down and can propagate bad things and is sort of generationally evil

technology is the most open and democratic, can work harder than capital, but can turn things into feudalism due to ownership
