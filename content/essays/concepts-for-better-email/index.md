Email has no gatekeepers save an internet connected device.

It feels amazing to get an email from someone you care about. It is inspiring to get a newsletter that you enjoy. Email is incredibly customizable, from intelligent filters, 

But somewhere along the way, email stopped working. In addition to all that

I read once that most meetings could be calls and most calls could be emails. I agree for the most part, but there are facets of synchronous communication that should not be pushed into asynchronous communication, and vice versa.

My thesis here is that everything great about email is still there, it's just buried under nonsense. In particular, email has been hijacked by a few unfortunate trends.

1. Many organizations and people want you to treat email as synchronous

#### The relationship with files should be recreated.

As it stands now, files are attached to individual emails. If you want to access the file, you upload it, send it, and then someone else downloads it somewhere else. You can't send big files, and sending a lot of files Why are files attached to individual emails; why not have emails surround files?

Google drive does this pretty well. You can attach

#### The spam process should be transparent.



#### Email scheduling and followups should be more robust.

Most email clients have services to schedule emails to be sent out at a certain time. Most people know these features exist and how to use them.

#### Marketing should not dominate your inbox.

Email marketing campaigns are a widespread plague. Of course it's important for companies to be able to reach you. get the word out about their product

#### Email should do what group chats cannot.

Rather than making email more and more like group chats, email should invest in its own strengths. Chats are great for hashing things out quickly, tossing fun or ideas back and forth, getting some quick feedback,
