In recent years, email has accrued a rather negative reputation. I think that's a tragedy. When email works, it's phenomenal. Email allows people across cultures, locations, communities - and even time - to communicate. Email is highly reliable and at its core incredibly simple. Email is a launchpad for ideas and its integrated into almost every software product. Email was the original digital identity. Email is the only truly asynchronous method of communication that has survived all innovations in the way we work. Email has no gatekeepers, save for an internet connected device.

It feels amazing to get an email from someone you care about. It is inspiring to get a newsletter that you enjoy.

Email is incredibly customizable, from intelligent filters, 

But somewhere along the way, email stopped working. In addition to all that

It's important to be abl

My general thesis is that everything that has always been great about email is still very much there, it's just buried.

I love email, and I think it deserves a place in our lives. Let's improve it. Here are some theories I've collected about email, and ideas about how to make email better:

#### Users

More than half of the global population uses email. There are roughly 3.9 billion active email users and 5.6 billion active email accounts. A lot of people depend on email as an open means of communicating and conducting business.

It's challenging to define email users other than by broad segmentation, because there are simply so many.

Core use cases

#### Core Problems and Pain Points

I read once that most meetings could be calls and most calls could be emails. I agree for the most part, but there are facets of synchronous communication that should not be pushed into asynchronous communication, and vice versa.



nonsense. In particular, email has been hijacked by a few unfortunate trends.

1. Many organizations and people want you to treat email as synchronous
2. Automation services and marketing campaigns send you things you don't want to see
3. 
4. (2) automation services without your best interest in mind, (3) (4) companies who build email clients



Email is one of the only consistent ways to get to you directly. It's not a post in a non-chronological social media feed where you might never see it, an in-app notification that might get swiped away, a phone call you might not pick up or hear ringing, a text that won't ever be delivered when you're out hiking in the mountains, a group message

It may not always be the fastest way to get you on the line, but it's 

It's a different, fundamentally trusted form of information transfer. And it goes directly to you

Therefore, it's no surprise at all that email all different kinds of people and businesses use email to try and cut through the clutter and slide into home base and get directly to your eyeballs.



#### Emails Aren't Homogeneous

Email has been adopted by an incredible number of varied groups in order to get to you. However, by the same token, email can serve a taxing number of purposes across a number of spectra. Mentally, we bucket kinds of emails we receive. In order to classify an email, we might ask ourselves many different kinds of questions. How important is it? How urgent is it? Is it marketing content? Is it marketing content I don't to see? Is it something I signed up for that looks like marketing content but really informative content? Is it a blog or subscription that I read every morning? Is it a newsletter I only read when and only when I have exhausted all other possible options for distraction? Is it a thread I need to stay updated on? Is it an email I'll need in the future?

These are just a few of the questions we



There are a few distinct classes of emails that we now receive substantial quantities

Email serves almost too many purposes. There are messages from

Emails proliferate. Emails quickly become massive chains of information that must be read through

If we don't prioritize... we lose

#### The Relationship with Files |?| The relationship with files should be recreated.

As it stands now, files are attached to individual emails. If you want to access the file, you upload it, send it, and then someone else downloads it somewhere else. This all seems pretty straightforward. However, the relationship of files and email was formed a long time ago when bandwidth was lower and before the advent of the cloud.



You can't send big files, and sending a lot of files is cumbersome. Once files are sent, they're sent

Why are files attached to individual emails; why not have emails surround files?

A simple version of this feature set may pool files that users have received or sent, allowing users to search through these files and apply filters such as 



Google drive does this pretty well. You can attach



#### What Spam Is Not | The spam process should be transparent |

Most modern email services have sophisticated spam 

Currently, email services harness user inputs like shifting emails out of spam and into the inbox in order to cater the spam detection algorithm to their needs. or specifically Rather than harnessing user inputs like providing input to a spam detection algorithm by way of , users should be able to provide 

Spam is not the same thing as boring, unhelpful, or unuseful.





This is one critical piece of making sure that you see the things that are most important and can delete or defer the rest.

#### Email scheduling and followups should be more robust.

Most email clients have services to schedule emails to be sent out at a certain time. Most people know these features exist and how to use them.



In order to

In any product design or architecture, there are tradeoffs. One of the most salient tradeoffs in the design of any consumer tech product is monetization by subscription, by customization, or by data collection.

Meetings should be

Everyone sending you an email is treated the same. That's nice from a democratization standpoint. For email to be open, everyone needs to be able to email everyone else. However, 

Behind the scenes, gmail may be assessing the likelihood of an email to be spam, and spam emails might be filtered out some of the time, but all those senders are still just in one big group. Why not let users create subgroups of contacts? Consider a system where you can define categories of emails, almost like filters, but from specific groups. Emails from your best friend or teammate: right to the front. Emails from your

Every group has norms for communication. People are perceiving it as more and more synchronous. The expectation of an immediate response is toxic.

#### Email should do what group chats cannot.

Rather than making email more and more like group chats, email should invest in its own strengths. Chats are great for hashing things out quickly, tossing fun or ideas back and forth, getting some quick feedback,
