# The Paradox of Tolerance



OUTLINE

===

I am, generally speaking, an incidental centrist. Or, I suppose, I was.



Generally speaking, I fall left of center on the left-right political spectrum, but not too far. On the authoritarian-libertarian spectrum, I fall almost dead center.

There are pieces of my political opinion that 

There are those who are centrists because their opinions fall





When I confront a political opinion or policy concept, I approach it from first principles. Among other questions,  what data confirms or falsifies the merit of this idea, and what are the implications of implementation, what do I know to be true about the world and ? I would like to think that





Hot issues tend to get lumped into either left-right, liberal-conservative, or libertarian-authoritarian. Yet, if you have any volume of discussions with other human beings in person, you typically find that most people are sat somewhere in the middle of all of these things, confused, and wanting to support their personal values and the needs of people who are close to them.



I hope to investigate why, even though a considerate, first principles philosophy

An unfortunate refrain I often see from those who consider themselves to be right of center, is that if a citizen of the United States disagrees with the preponderance of the country's history or direction, they  might be better of living somewhere else. That is, in fact, too kind a way to say it. The comments themselves often go something like this: "If you don't support American freedom to [insert freedom], leave our country."

The left engages in a similar form of exclusion: "if y"

I have a great deal of disdain for this kind of expression.



It is also important to note, that the definition of freedom here is highly obscure. Freedom to do exactly what, to impact exactly who, and on what scale? My freedom to own private property and feel safe in secure in my home may interfere with someone's right to bear arms. of My right to bear arms may decrease my neighbor's freedom to feel safe and secure in their home. My freedom from providing undue resources to the state may interfere with someone's freedom to be protected by the military, have

My freedom to be protected by the military, have access to food and water, public infrastructure, and healthcare may interfere in someone's freedom to provide undue resources to the state.



My perspective on all issues thus far has followed this vein of reasoning. We should all





In 1945, philosopher Karl Popper posited the paradox of tolerance, which states that if a society is tolerant without limit, its ability to be tolerant is eventually seized or destroyed by the intolerant

In this way, war is inevitable.

A corollary of this statement, is that conflict is inevitable, and we should not seek to avoid or overlook conflict for the sake of minimizing it.



In my view, this is another way of expressing a multipolar trap. (LINK?)

Where that line lies is incredibly unclear.





Change at too rapid a pace threatens to alienate a great number of people. By definition, conservatives are late stage on the adoption curve

I also believe that change at too rapid a pace threatens to alienate 

There is a class of people who we may consider the 'good' ones. Those people who speak up when they confront evident racism. Those people who

If only there were evil people somewhere insidiously committing evil deeds, and it were necessary only to separate them from the rest of us and destroy them. But the line dividing good and evil cuts through the heart of every human being. And who is willing to destroy a piece of his own heart?

We have a tendency to express tolerance for contentious opinions that are expressed openly.

In delineating the 'good' from the 'bad' in groups of protesters, we implicitly express that some people are less worthy of protection than others. Are there really any of 



If two groups are mutually unaccountable to each other, they can do each other immense harm. If there is no way of immediately resolving the positions on which they are at odds, we must ask what harm we expect and what harm we can prevent. If one of these groups is

My enduring stance towards theft has been that

One stance toward looting is that stealing of any kind devalues



the traditional stance that stealing devalues the concept of property ownership does not take into consideration the extent to which the concept of property ownership precludes others, often based on race or class, from ever attaining ownership or sharing in the benefits of ownership of an entity for which they create value

Would you be as content to defend property ownership rights if you knew you could never share in any of the benefits of ownership?
