One of the things that so often happens is that law relies on intent. Did they intend to harm? If you're the victim, it doesn't so much matter what they intended. Most car accidents probably don't involve intent.



It seems to me that we don't need to make rules around the things that rarely happened, or that could be happening in the future, until we finish up making rules about the things that are happening regularly right now.
