description: Writing is boring, it's not differentiated, too many people do it, it's oversaturated with people trying to make it big, no one reads it, and you're not that smart. It's also potentially the most important thing you can possibly do to better yourself.

A lot of people do it. Your stuff isn't going to get written

When I say that I seek to answer the question 'why' in this scenario, I mean a few things. Primarily, 

Secondarily, I am interested in the origin of the impulse. I believe that investigation of this 





Why I write, is actually an entirely different question.



There is more than a whiff of narcissism in creation.



Here are my reasons, briefly summarized:

* Writing is discovery ―

* Writing is thinking ―

  Writing is a process by which the potential lying in the entangled thoughts and perceptions in your mind can be unraveled and woven into something great. It is not just for the reader, it is for you.

* Writing is thinking ―

  Writing is a process by which the potential lying in the entangled thoughts and perceptions in your mind can be unraveled and woven into something great. It is not just for the reader, it is for you.

* Writing is connecting ―

  This is the most spiritual, but also the most capitalistic reason on this list. There are few spaces on the internet, let alone amongst communities in the world, that will investigate the fusion of the domains you care about in the way you want to see them investigated.



#### Writing _is_ Discovery

E.M. Forster's classic quote:

> "How do I know what I think until I see what I say?"



#### Writing _is_ Thinking
Anecdotally it is evident that even simply talking about an idea improves the quality of our thinking and increases the likelihood of a thought leading to a chain of realizations and connections, and potentially, action. However, a standard conversation involves at minimum two distinct parties with agendas that must coexist in the ebb and flow of dialogue and th efundamental

* Framing your thoughts with It is potentially the most 
"How do I know what I think until I see what I say"
I think all the time. I think about what I read, I think about what I hear, and I have an internal monologue that cannot stop thinking!

Allows you to process

Otherwise, knowledge may enter the file of uselessness

#### Writing _is_ truth

First, you can exorcise some serious shit

> "Writing is my way of expressing ― and thereby eliminating ― all the various ways we can be wrong-headed."

> ― Zadie Smith

We can take in the world and spit it out back again differently as to be rephrased in the context we desire.



Second, you can narrativize and make meaning.

> “That’s why I write, because life never works except in retrospect. You can’t control life, at least you can control your version.”
>

#### Writing _is_ codification

The things you believe become your reality, the things you see repeatedly, the things you repeat and the things you ruminate on become the things you believe. Therefore,  I don't mean in the sense of some mojo vision board. I mean a 

Writing as a technology is displaced from time.

#### Writing _is_ yours

> “Any writer worth his salt writes to please himself… It’s a self-exploratory operation that is endless. An exorcism of not necessarily his demon, but of his divine discontent.”
>
> – Harper Lee

#### Writing _is_ Refining

Ira glass put it best:

> "Nobody tells this to people who are beginners, I wish someone told me. All of us who do creative work, we get into it because we have good taste. But there is this gap. For the first couple years you make stuff, it’s just not that good. It’s trying to be good, it has potential, but it’s not. But your taste, the thing that got you into the game, is still killer. And your taste is why your work disappoints you. A lot of people never get past this phase, they quit. Most people I know who do interesting, creative work went through years of this. We know our work doesn’t have this special thing that we want it to have. We all go through this. And if you are just starting out or you are still in this phase, you gotta know its normal and the most important thing you can do is do a lot of work. Put yourself on a deadline so that every week you will finish one story. It is only by going through a volume of work that you will close that gap, and your work will be as good as your ambitions. And I took longer to figure out how to do this than anyone I’ve ever met. It’s gonna take awhile. It’s normal to take awhile. You’ve just gotta fight your way through."

#### Writing _is not_ Experiencing

Unfortunately for me, it took a while to realize that

To make a construct of a piece of writing, or for that matter, a human being, is to turn them into some abstracted form. Although in this form, we can have quite a bit of fun with analysis, an abstraction is very much incapable of communication back, a vital dimension to a real social interaction.

Writing can be used to compensate for what the real world does not provide. There is a grave danger in this. Supplement can be a boon. Crutches create dependencies which may limite your ability to then go and receive that thing in a more healthy way.

#### Writing _is not_ A Guarantee

Logical validity is certainly not truth. If you are able to choose the premises upon which you argue, you can prove most any conclusion.

Creators themselves are not smarter or more talented than other people. The one thing we may say about them is that they have crossed a barrier of anxiety that most encounter when feeling the impulse to create. If anything, I think many creators, writers in particular, perform well and gain renown solely because they are more compelling in their idiocy or in their confusion. As we see clearly in examples as diverse as the polarization of traditional news media, the continual rise of internet echo chambers, and the organic development of polarized communities on social media, polarizing and emotionally jarring content is much more desired and certainly more autopoietic than nuanced middle-of-the-road content.

#### Writing _is not_ Noble

Or, I should say, writing is not _more_ noble. Creation is hard. Creation of any kind requires the mind to walk the line of insanity, as it requires a concrete vision of something not the least bit concrete. It requires a bit of insanity. It requires seeing something in front of you as plain as day, something which in reality is truly not there.

Contrary to the, I find that creators are not a different class of person

There is, on the internet, aI find that creators are not at all a fundamentally different class in any way other than of personality.

Most work requires creation

We seem to have forgotten the nobility of the everyman

#### Writing _is not_ 

If you have a negative relationship with your own thinking, many of the otherwise large benefits listed above can instead make concrete these harmful modes of interaction.

#### Why write 'Why Write?'?

Many great creators have produced their own version of this essay. I quite enjoy [George Orwell's one]().



> “So why do I write, torturing myself to put it down? Because in spite of myself I’ve learned some things. Without the possibility of action, all knowledge comes to one labeled ‘file and forget,’ and I can neither file nor forget. Nor will certain ideas forget me; they keep filing away at my lethargy, my complacency. Why should I be the one to dream this nightmare?”
>
> – Ralph Ellison
