# Automating the Analyst

If you asked a financier in the 1970s what skills you should learn in order to succeed in the business, he might have told you to get really good at using a handheld calculator. After all, the job of a lot of financial analysts used to be to print out large tables of financial metrics and compute new rows of data by hand. Given his life experience - what he experienced rising through the industry, what he sees on a daily basis in his company, and his future outlook - this answer would have been justified. Given what would happen as personal computing continued to develop, he would have be *very* *very* wrong.

As we now know, handheld calculators do not exactly dominate industry. The paradigm of how information is captured, computed, and shared has evolved and will continue to evolve rapidly.

Perhaps, if we expand and abstract this advice, we may arrive at something that looks more correct. Maybe 'learn how to use a handheld calculator' becomes 'learn how to crunch numbers'. This reformulation gets us somewhere. However, if the dominant technology of the era used to crunch numbers is indeed the handheld calculator, we're back to square one. Maybe crunching numbers is too vague, perhaps we need something obnoxiously specific such as 'become comfortable with precise numerosity'. We're getting somewhere. At this point, we could be proposing advice well-suited to a financier, an accountant, a mathematician, a small business owner, or a rocket engineer. Then again, rocket scientists used Hewlett-Packard handheld calculators to get the first American on the moon. Or we could go in the other direction, 'learn corporate finance and accounting'. Yet, learning these things doesn't really train you to do well in financial services, especially depending on what field you enter. Better might be, 'learn how to learn different disciplines of math and finance quickly and thoroughly', but then, is he just advising you to eat well, get enough sleep, and suggesting that maybe you'll only succeed if you attend a top university and have a knack for picking things up quickly?

Yes, it's hard to give advice. Without knowing the future, it would be really hard to guarantee giving good advice. As we broaden our statements, things get confusing. As we narrow them, they have less of a chance of being correct. The problem I want to address here, however, isn't that good advice is hard.

The problem is that if the head of the industry you want to enter tells you to focus on learning how to use a handheld calculator, you're fucked.



Maybe you're reading this and thinking to yourself one of the following things:

If I were entering an industry, I would know better, ask better questions, or spend time more wisely

Bankers aren't technologists and finance isn't the most futuristic industry, so they wouldn't know better

I'm not in finance and would never be in finance



Any or all of the above can certainly be correct for you. However, between 40-50% of graduates from top universities in the United States

Surely they 

How do they get there

So, in a world where How do we figure out 



Do these universities flawlessly collect the most intelligent and impeccable young members of the human species? Certainly not. 



Although studied computer science in school, I have been fascinated by the dynamics of the job market 

Here is what I saw. I saw teams of bright, young, motivated people learn







So, if you were trying to enter the finance industry in the 1970s, what would the most relevant skills have been? Would you have learned excel? Would you have built excel?







One of the most egregious uses of time is to become efficient at something which simply does not need to be done.

You can think about this

Do you need to become good

Ruthless efficiency in the short term often means a lack of investment in the future. When shortsightedness





My experience

Here are a few of the worst examples.

Analysts staffed on live deals - clients who were in the process of acquiring a firm or being acquired - often 



Imagine, instead, that you spent 80 hours a week learning to code.





Becoming really good at modeling is an

If you don't get to the point where you can build this in a few minutes, you'll never get to the point where you can look at it and immediately know what numbers look wrong, what trends should or should not be incorporated, and learn how to use that resultant information in 

As I've spoken to people across the spectra of age, profession, 



My take is that the core idea is correct: if you aren't good at the basics, then you will likely be inefficient at reasoning on levels above the basics. Everyone needs a certain level of pattern recognition in o



Every profession has their own version of this concept (and they think that its some sort of )

Bankers call this conceptVCs call this pattern recog



My point of discontent is in what 'the basics' should really mean, especially with our modern ability to automate



We redo an immense amount of work.



THe principle of the hacker is that anything can be learned and work should not be redone.

Let's take an example that young professionals will be all too familiar with: creating a deck.

As an estimate, most analysts I know spend anywhere from 30% to 80% of their time working in PowerPoint to create decks that are shown internally or externally to clients. This work involves a 

The important part of that work, is to learn how to cut ideas







One of the most interesting elements of these 'middle-man' businesses is the fact that they get to see so many different operations. 

This in and of itself is one of the biggest reasons why these services command such a high price point: cumulative experience. You're not paying for a consultant to tell you to cut costs, you're paying for 

(Separately, I may completely believe that these services are dramatically overpriced and that the fact a company regularly works with them rather than building out internal teams or taking advantage of automated services is )









At a senior level, most of your responsibilities revolve

Why would we not set analysts up to do this kind of work

The way things are currently done represents an immense inefficiency, not just because of the tasks which are or are not done, but because the limit of learning is your ability to productively reflect on and integrate

There are at least, but probably far more than, two types of learning occurring here. The first is something fundamentally procedural: where my fingers should go when I want to create a certain kind of element, 

The second is something fundamentally declarative of empirical

And the third, if we ever get there, 

The assumption that reflective learning happens regardless of context is naive and idiotic.

Expertise requires intention, not just practice.

Some intention comes organically from desire to become good at something, and some comes organically from time pressure and desire for validation. I have to do this quickly and well, so I will invest in those abilities. However, you can only direct a large amount of that directed intention can only come from exposure to a higher standard than the one you currently possess. It is, for instance, incredibly unlikely that will become a master of tennis if you only play against subpar players or against only the same player.

There are 





If you ask a senior person in any professional discipline, they'll tell you that the requirements of their job have shifted dramatically

We used to consider it important 

Before excel, banking analysts used to have to put tables of numbers together by hand. Using calculators

A refrain from the 60s [???] was that if you can't use a calculator fast enough, you're not fit for the job because you'll never learn

So why is it so hard for senior people to see that this is happening consistently and at a an even more rapid pace?









An important dimension here is that in highly competitive client service businesses such as financial services and consulting, your clients will largely also be old men. Old men trust other old men, not computers.

I hypothesize that this is simply a consistent cognitive delusion. Unless rising sea levels k

future generations will always learn different skills, in different ways,

By considering what elements of the job are important, we not only prepare our business for future trends in work, but also set our junior people up for success and fulfillment.
