# Copylefting



In the age of internet abundance, entities that try to entirely own information are doomed to fail.

Means that the license allows for free distribution, use, and modification of copyrighted material with the stipulation that those same rights expend to all derivative works.



I posit that we should adopt the copyleft principle in the context of ideas and writing. This requires the addition of a few additional principles. First, if you make use of someone's ideas or words, 

Second, distribution must be free, but you can still profit.

If the New York Times were to rip an article off of your site and put it behind a paywall, that wouldn't feel so good. However, if another 

Adoption of the copyleft principle benefits writing in a few key ways.

Firstly, if you create something

A copy of a program has nearly zero marginal cost (and you can pay this cost by doing the work yourself), so in a free market, it would be worth nearly nothing in terms of price. A license fee is a significant disincentive to use the pgoram. If a widely useful program is proprietary, far fewer people will use it. (NTS: far fewer people using a piece of software is analogous to far fewer people using a piece of writing and the ideas within it. This entails less  discussion, less proliferation, and ultimately, less refinement of that piece of writing. This is bad for everyone!)

It is easy to show that the total contribution of a program to society is reduced by assigning an owner to it. Each potential user of the program, faced with the need to pay to use it, may choose to pay or may forego use of the program. When a user chooses to pay, this is azero sum transfer of wealth between tow parties. But each time someone chooses to forego use of the program, this harms that person without benefiting anyone. The sum of negative numbers and zeroes must be negative.

But this does not reduce the amount of work it takes to develop the program. As a result, the efficiency of the whole process, in delivered user staisfaction per hour of work, is reduced.

As we have seen in the monetization models for open source companies, once cloud computing is dominant, the economic model is much more challenging.

This should give a bit of pause to anyone who would to purely copy and platform. Their core competency is not production of content and ideas, but rather distribution. So, if content stagnates, their business stagnates. They must at least to some extent invest in the network which produces, or provide attractive options to those who produce, for production to continue. Right now, everyone wins, but simply following the economic reality could, in the long run, make everyone substantially worse off.

Unfortunately, your differentiation is never going to your platform. You will never own the consumer touchpoint. (But you can get pretty close and should definitely try) Your differentiator is your unique thought
