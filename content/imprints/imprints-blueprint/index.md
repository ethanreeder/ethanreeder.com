We consume a lot of different kinds of media every day. Although our consumption - in volume, variety, and pace - is increasing, the rate at which we can reflect on and integrate this various media is not keeping pace. In the age of the internet, things tend to get lost. Not lost like on a desert island, but rather lost as in your keys under the couch. They're definitely somewhere in the house, but you can't quite put your finger on it. So for fun, for my own education, and for my future self, I'm going to compile those things that have impacted me... at least those that I can identify consciously. I'm calling this effort _Imprints_, for the impression, influence, and lasting joy or sorrow that each piece has left in me.



It is estimated that as of 2015 most Americans are exposed to from 4,000 to 10,000 advertisements every day.
